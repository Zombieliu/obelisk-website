# Features

The practice of building web applications is enormously diverse. Frameworks like MUD,Dojo.

When building a Engine, we needed to consider which features would be:

- **Built-in**: they work out of the box, no config required
- **Available via plugins**: usually installed from a registry and configured
- **Usability**: Everyone can get started quickly

**Obelisk is in beta**, so very few of these decisions are set in stone. In its current state, **Obelisk cannot yet be configured** - so plugins are not available yet.

Let's discuss which features are available out-of-the-box, in Obelisk's default configuration. We'll also touch on features which will be configurable via plugins.
