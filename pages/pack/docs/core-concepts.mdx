# Core Concepts

Let’s dive deep into the internals of Obelisk to figure out why it’s so good.

## The Obelisk Engine

Obelisk Engine is so good because it’s built on a reusable library for Sui Move Here’s how it works:

### High Level Abstraction

Obelisk Framework in Obelisk Engine assumes an important role of infrastructure abstraction, through the implementation of ECS-like architecture in Sui move, as well as with the user experience editor of the traditional engine architecture such as unreal, unity, cocos, etc. to make non-financial complex application scenarios of the birth rate greatly increased.

### Easy-to-Use High-Level Data Indexing and Access Client

With Obelisk Engine's Obelisk SDK, you can efficiently read and write Dapps based on Obelisk Framework on the user target platforms supported by the SDK. By default, the Obelisk Engine integrates the Obelisk SDK into the legacy technology scaffolding and engine, making it easy for creators to use.

### Open Customized Plug-ins


Through Obelisk Engine's Plugins section, creators can be based on the basis of the secondary modification of the use of Plugins provide a high intensity of customization and expansion of the function, such as the business has a very high processing requirements for hot data, you can develop a cache cache plugin on the basis of the chain attached to the framework

### Highly available additional services technology stack

Obelisk Engine will gradually open up some of the efficiency to reduce costs of the technology stack services, if the business user level scale of communication, transaction processing, state synchronization and other high requirements can be achieved through the shared/non-shared sequencer.
